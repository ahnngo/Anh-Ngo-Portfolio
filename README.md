# Project 1: [Survival Chance during Titanic Tragedy](https://github.com/ahnngo/bank-stocks-affected-by-covid)
*	Created a machine learning model to predict what is the chance of a person to survive on the Titanic Tragedy
*	Optimized Logistic Regression to generate good f-1 scores of 0.87 (0) and 0.76 (1)
*	Deployed one-hot encoding to convert categorical data to numerical data

# Project 2: [Impacts of the COVID Pandemic on the 15 largest American banks](https://github.com/ahnngo/bank-stocks-affected-by-covid)
* Built data frames demonstrating stock prices of largest banks in the USA from 2019-01-01 to 2022-03-14 by reading data from Yahoo finance and HTML dataset from bankrate.com for stock prices of largest banks in the USA
* Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn effectively to demonstrate the stock prices fluctuations during the timeframe and what dates each bank stock had the best and worst single-day returns
* Compared the impacts of the COVID pandemic versus the 2007-2009 Great Recession on bank stocks using appropriate plotting and scattering methods

# Project 3: [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/ahnngo/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
* Created a tool that estimates housing price (MAE ~ $20K) to help predicting housing prices based on house's features
* Optimized Linear Regression to reach the best model
* Deployed one-hot encoding to turn 60+ categorical columns of data into numerical types

# Project 4: [Analyzing Vietnamese Graduation Score](https://github.com/ahnngo/analyzing_vietnamese_graduation_score_2020)
* Exploited Python to curl and clean data of 74000 + candidates, including full names, DOB, and scores for 11 exams
* Utilized rigorously NumPy and Pandas to create 5+ DataFrames for plotting
* Utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas built-in visualization tools flexibly draw 10+ charts for testing null hypothesis
* Created a database in pgAdmin and extracted output using SQL queries to assess the coding part's accuracy and efficiency and detect errors in the dataset
