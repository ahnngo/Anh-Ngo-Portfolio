# Project 2: [Impacts of the COVID Pandemic on the 15 largest American banks](https://github.com/ahnngo/bank-stocks-affected-by-covid)
* Built data frames demonstrating stock prices of largest banks in the USA from 2019-01-01 to 2022-03-14 by reading data from Yahoo finance and HTML dataset from bankrate.com for stock prices of largest banks in the USA
* Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn effectively to demonstrate the stock prices fluctuations during the timeframe and what dates each bank stock had the best and worst single-day returns
* Compared the impacts of the COVID pandemic versus the 2007-2009 Great Recession on bank stocks using appropriate plotting and scattering methods

# Project 3: [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/ahnngo/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
* Created a tool that estimates housing price (MAE ~ $20K) to help predicting housing prices based on house's features
* Optimized Linear to reach the best model.
* Deployed one-hot encoding to turn 60+ categorical columns of data into numerical types
